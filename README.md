Hi DBC, it's Tara, current Fox.  

Here's a really cool event: 

The Innovation Ranch @SxSw is a free weeklong hackathon in Texas March 10-15

I'm sad I can't go (still in DBC), but the next best thing is to tell all of my friends why this is an awesome event and why you should go if can.

Best reason to go: Building cool things with the engineers from Inventables is MUCH more fun when you're outdoors in 70 degree Texas weather.

I'm friends with the organizer, Moshe Tamssot, who is a founder of the Monks of Innovation and is building a startup called  makeitfor.us.  Make it for us is "an ebay for things that don't exist yet, but should."   

He invites all of DBC to hang out at the Innovation Ranch during South By Southwest.  Registration is here:       http://monksofinvention.com/join-us-sxsw/. Note: there's two events on this page. You want Innovation Ranch @SxSw, NOT conclave. Conclave is a single dinner: Innovation Ranch @SxSw is a week-long make-a-thon

      Note #1: there's two events on this page. You want Innovation Ranch @SxSw, NOT Conclave
      
      Note #2: Like Burning Man, housing is free. People who register now can snag floor space in the barn.  Otherwise, bring a tent, camping gear, and whatever supplies you need to invent things!
      Recommended trip budget: $300.  Assume $100 for food, (monks like to barbecue, so you can chip in) and, if four people car-pool, $100-$200 for gas round-trip.

Where: Innovation Ranch in Elgin, TX 
   After you register, the exact address will be e-mailed to you.  
    
When: March 10 - 15, same time as South By Southwest

Why: Because making things is fun.  

Cheers,
Tara Roys

P.S.  I can't go because of school, so my second-best option is to live vicariously through all of you. Enjoy! :D
